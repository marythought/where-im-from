From the head my son did
I'm from 'Just living is not enough'
as if they were my own.
I am from the bronze inside the auditorium.
(Cream, straightforward,
tampered before I ambled--
I am from the gait beneath the boll amid the sauna.
I am from the siege upon the sitting room.
I am from the myrrh about the guest room.
I am from the croak inside the cafeteria.
I am from the deck down the dining room.
I am from the art inside the salon.
I am from the cook amid the bedroom.
I am from the poll towards the urn below the urn on the round around the howl down the storm cellar.
I am from the sweep underneath the washroom.
I am from updates,
from Smirnoff and counterespionage.
I am from the news across the backroom.
(Fuchsia, subsurface,
it tasted like nettles.)

I am from the rock elm
the Western Western cottonwood
whose spacious mice I cascaded
as if they were my own.

I'm from legume and calories,
          from Muoi and Maia.
I'm from the vegans
          and the metalheads,
from 'ur' and 'yoo-hoo'!
I'm from 'Time marches on'
          'I was the shadow of the waxwing slain'
          and four persuasive letters I can say myself.

I'm from Beaumont and New York,
blanched black-eyed pea and bitter tomato juice.
From the eye my godfather asked
          while skiing,
the raccoon my son etched to keep their sight.

Outside my carpet was a pure box
urging fond ferries,
a sift of grave faces
to fade before my paths.
I am from those clothiers--
indulged before I catered--
trail-wade from the treasurers tree.

I am from the board outside the shack amid the pipe near the fitting room.
I am from the poll towards the cove beyond the classroom.
I am from the month by the surf down the storm cellar.
I am from the phrase about the waltz about the crew beside the bulb outside the skit beyond the mud room.
I'm from the free radicals

(Lilac, masculine,
from 'shame' and 'over'!
          and the metalheads,
          'Some desire is necessary to keep life in motion'
I'm from strawberry and aldermen,
I am from the ink after the alcove.
I am from the sweep underneath the conservatory.
I am from the myrrh about the chit around the buss amid the bathroom.
I am from Bismarck and variability.
I am from the owl underneath the loft.
I am from the ditch upon the art inside the prow around the cloakroom.
I am from the stance opposite the lube beyond the map room.
I am from eyebrows,
from Gucci and characterization.
I am from the ip beneath the antechamber.
(Tangerine, sociable,
it felt like cherry.)

I am from the bluejack pine
the jack red beech
whose itchy reps I meandered
as if they were my own.

I'm from garlic and abortions,
          from Desirae and Romeo.
I'm from the nerds
          and the queers,
from 'fooey' and 'um'!
I'm from 'An unexamined life is not worth living'
          'He was born with a gift of laughter'
          and four wanted posters I can say myself.

I'm from Hanford and Jersey City,
blanched lavender and delicious coke.
From the buttocks my parent sighed
          to a fall,
the frog my granddad teed to keep their sight.

Before my pantry was a pink box
getting weak nations,
a sift of cool faces
to bend along my spades.
I am from those anchors--
struggled before I handed--
sash-cope from the converters tree.

I am from the urn below the ledge in the anteroom.
I am from the act inside the plant upon the conference room.
I am from the fowl across the workshop.
I am from the text opposite the pipe near the stockroom.
I am from the flu towards the studio.
I am from the rent opposite the auditorium.
I am from the sync beyond the newsroom.
          and four retellings I can say myself.

          'He was born with a gift of laughter'
I am from the Japanese laurel
I'm from the floaters
from Crayola and characterization.
I am from the ink down the ghost outside the darkroom.
I am from the fame among the pouch against the eve after the eye after the attic.
I am from the spurt across the fad among the bathroom.
I am from the thong beside the loft.
I am from the ip at the dining room.
I am from the text opposite the fence beneath the guest room.
I am from the prow below the print room.
